Welcome to my whack at OpenPilot

This build is focused on the GM Volt, while most features will work with all GM vehicles.

Step 1 - Kang a copy of Arne's sublime 058 test release.
Step 2 - Add in some code from Kegman
Step 3 - Stir.

What's in it?
* Assume all features from Arne 058 are present.
* Added ALCA above 50 MPH only
* Added Disable LKA below 40 MPH w/ turn signals
* Early release of Adaptive Follow mapped to Follow level position two
* Cruise Accel/Decel set to two MPH
* LKA Button on Steering wheel works
* Return of the steering wheel in the upper right

Work In Progress
* Follow The Leader
    When you are following someone for greater than sixty seconds and more then 6 KPH below your set speed, you get a prompt.  The idea here is to alert you when you are following someone and they are slowing your pace.
